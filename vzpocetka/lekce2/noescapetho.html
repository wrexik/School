            Hello members of the community,
            <br>
            After the first week of your stay, you will be asked to participate in a ritual. This ritual is a very important part of our community and we ask that you participate. If you do not participate, you will be excommunicated by the community and you will paricipate in a hide and seek.
            <br>
            Menu for the week:
            <ul>
                <li>Monday: Soup</li>
                <li>Tuesday: Salad</li>
                <li>Wednesday: Bread</li>
                <li>Thursday: Water</li>
                <li>Friday: Soup</li>
                <li>Saturday: Salad</li>
                <li>Sunday: Bread</li>
            </ul>
